# Cesar's Cypher decoder
## Chi-Squared algorithm

Use frequency analysis to break Caesarâ€™s cipher. This is a brute force method that tests all the
possible displacements and returns the most likely decryption of a text.

>Frequency analysis relies on the fact that some letters (or combination of letters ) occur more in a
language, regardless of the text size. For example, in English the letters E, A are the most frequent,
while the Z and Q are the least frequent;
